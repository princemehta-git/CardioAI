## üìÅ Dataset Information

The default dataset is derived from the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease), featuring:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Age | Age in years |
| Sex | Gender (1 = male, 0 = female) |
| CP | Chest pain type (0-3) |
| Trestbps | Resting blood pressure (mm Hg) |
| Chol | Serum cholesterol (mg/dl) |
| FBS | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false) |
| RestECG | Resting electrocardiographic results |
| Thalach | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| Exang | Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no) |
| Oldpeak | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest |
| Slope | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment |
| CA | Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3) |
| Thal | Thalassemia (normal, fixed defect, reversible defect) |

Target column: `1 = heart disease present`, `0 = no heart disease`
